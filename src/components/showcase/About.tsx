                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                From a young age, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how things work, which naturally sparked my obsession with technology and passion for building. 
                After graduating, I joined Nxt Wave Online Institute for my first in-depth exposure to programming. In 2023, my family and 
                I relocated from Kakinada to Rajahmundry, where I completed my middle school, high school, and college education.

                I began focusing on programming more seriously during my undergraduate studies,
                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with
                    one of my closest friends,{' '}

                    In 2017, I got accepted into Rennselear Polytechnic
                    Institute to study Computer Science. It was my first choice
                    and I was absolutely ecstatic to be going to such a great
                    university. At the end of my sophomore year, I got an
                    internship working for the startup Hover, primarily focusing
                    on frontend work. I continued to work at Hover on and off
                    for about a year and a half, until the start of my senior
                    year when I decided to focus on other opportunities.

                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible

                            enjoy are working out, Photography, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.

                        In college, I was actively involved in cultural activities and held several leadership roles in related organizations.
